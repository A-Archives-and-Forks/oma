Notes for Contributors
===

Your contributions are welcome in the form of pull requests. To ease review and, more importantly, for timely reviews of bug-fixes and features, please follow the following guidelines when opening pull requests:

- Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to format your commit headings and messages - extra credits for detailed explanantion of your proposed changes in the main commit message.
- For bug-fixes and minor changes to interface and behaviors, please submit your patches to the `master` branch for inclusion in the current "major" series.
- For overhauls, refactors, and new features, please submit your patches to the `next` branch for inclusion in the next "major" series.

Branching
---

By and large, oma follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and uses a three-segment versioning scheme (`x.y.z`):

- X: Major series, for major features, overhauls, and function refactors.
- Y: Minor series, for minor changes to interface to behaviors.
- Z: Patch series, for bugfixes only.
